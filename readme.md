Hey guys, thanks for Checking out my code in my Github.

What you see here is a "San Diego Top Spots" webapp.
This is what happens, Upon loading the app, a table is populated with data from a JSON file, in turn that lists a description, name and location (using Google Maps) of popular tourist spots around San Diego to visit.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ static .' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice.
